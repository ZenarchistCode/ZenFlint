What Is This?

This mod adds a fire-starting flint to the game.

Use any small steel item on the flint to prepare it for use (eg. knives, hatchets, axes, even some tools like a crowbar/pliers/screwdriver).

Once you've "paired" a striking item to the flint, you can use the flint like you would lighters/matches etc.

Just be aware that using the flint will damage your striking tool over time, and the flint has a limited quantity which depletes over time and when it hits zero it cannot be used anymore (and there is no way to replenish the flint - so at that point it's time to throw it away and find a new one!)

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be installed on both server and client.

Make sure to merge the types.xml included in the mod folder into your server types to make the flint spawn in the world.

Buy Me A Coffee:

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
